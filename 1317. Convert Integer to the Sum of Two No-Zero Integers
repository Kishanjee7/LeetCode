No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.

Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:

a and b are No-Zero integers.
a + b = n
The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.

 

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Let a = 1 and b = 1.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 2 = n.

Example 2:
Input: n = 11
Output: [2,9]
Explanation: Let a = 2 and b = 9.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 11 = n.
Note that there are other valid answers as [8, 3] that can be accepted.






Code
class Solution {
    public int[] getNoZeroIntegers(int n) {
        int a=1; 
        int b=n-1;
        while(!checkValid(a) || !checkValid(b)){
            a++;
            b--;
        }
        return new int[]{a,b};
    }
    public static boolean checkValid(int i){
        while(i>0){
            if(i%10==0){
                return false;
            }
            i=i/10;
        }
        return true;
    }
