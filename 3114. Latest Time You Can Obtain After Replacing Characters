You are given a string s representing a 12-hour format time where some of the digits (possibly none) are replaced with a "?".

12-hour times are formatted as "HH:MM", where HH is between 00 and 11, and MM is between 00 and 59. The earliest 12-hour time is 00:00, and the latest is 11:59.

You have to replace all the "?" characters in s with digits such that the time we obtain by the resulting string is a valid 12-hour format time and is the latest possible.

Return the resulting string.

 

Example 1:
Input: s = "1?:?4"
Output: "11:54"
Explanation: The latest 12-hour format time we can achieve by replacing "?" characters is "11:54".

Example 2:
Input: s = "0?:5?"
Output: "09:59"
Explanation: The latest 12-hour format time we can achieve by replacing "?" characters is "09:59".





Code
class Solution {
    public String findLatestTime(String s) {
        char[] t = s.toCharArray();

        if(t[0]=='?'){
            if(t[1]=='?' || t[1]=='0' || t[1]=='1'){
                t[0]='1';
            }else{
                t[0]='0';
            }
        }

        if(t[1]=='?'){
            if(t[0]=='1'){
                t[1]='1';
            }else{
                t[1]='9';
            }
        }

        if(t[3]=='?'){
            t[3]='5';
        }
        if(t[4]=='?'){
            t[4]='9';
        }

        return new String(t);
    }
}
