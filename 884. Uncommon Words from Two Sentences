A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:
Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]
Explanation:
The word "sweet" appears only in s1, while the word "sour" appears only in s2.

Example 2:
Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"
Output: ["banana"]






Code
class Solution {
    public String[] uncommonFromSentences(String s1, String s2) {
        String s= s1+ " "+s2;

        HashMap<String, Integer> map= new HashMap<>();
        String[] words= s.split(" ");
        for (String word: words){
            map.put(word,map.getOrDefault(word,0)+1);
        }

        ArrayList<String> ans= new ArrayList<>();
        for(String i: map.keySet()){
            if(map.get(i)==1){
                ans.add(i);
            }
        }
        return ans.toArray(new String[0]);
    }
}
